## Searching with Bloom Filters

I built a search engine for my sites — it's small, fast, private, and doesn't require a server. Then I tried to explain it to a generalist audience in less than 15 minutes. [View the _Searching with Bloom Filters_ talk slides](https://goblindegook.github.io/talks/bloom-search.html) and the [`@pacote/bloom-search` module on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pacote/bloom-search).

## @testing-library

Frontend test automation seems hard but it's only as hard as you make it. Are you bogged down by endless component tests and still not sure your application won't break? I talk about the advantages of testing your frontend from the perspective of the people using it, and bust some myths about unit testing and the supposed convenience of shallow component rendering.

## When Engineers Pair with Product Managers

How do you get engineers more involved in business decisions? How do you make product managers more aware of delivery opportunities and difficulties? How can they meaningfully challenge each other? A conversation with Neha Datt, Ali Asad Lotia and Luís Rodrigues around the benefits of stepping outside our comfort zone for a closer collaboration between engineering and product management roles.

## More Tests, Less Work

Writing tests can be tricky. How do you ensure appropriate coverage yet keep things straightforward and maintainable? Generative (or property-based) testing frameworks exist to reinforce your tests with hundreds of randomised checks, but they require changing your test design mentality. This talk introduces [fast-check](https://github.com/dubzzz/fast-check) and its underpinnings, and suggests strategies to help you make the most of it immediately.

## [<del>Designing</del> Developing for Humans](/2016/designing-developing-humans)

Think UX is a designer's job? Think again. Everybody has a responsibility to provide their visitors with an excellent experience, and sometimes a pretty interface and smooth animations aren't enough to save your site, your app, or your business. UX goes beyond your device's screen---CPUs, slow networks, random number generators and the economy may well conspire to ruin your day.
