Most of my open source endeavours revolve around the web, using TypeScript or just plain old JavaScript. The list below is only a selection of projects that I started --- you are welcome to visit [my profile page on Github](https://github.com/goblindegook/) for a fuller picture of my work and interests.

[`@pacote/*`](https://github.com/PacoteJS/pacote)
: A collection of utilities written in TypeScript and distributed under the [`@pacote` organisation on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/org/pacote).

[littlefoot](https://www.npmjs.com/package/littlefoot)
: A jQuery-free rewrite of Chris Sauvé's [Bigfoot.js](https://github.com/lemonmade/bigfoot) for delightful footnotes, as used on this site.[^littlefoot]

[Scopa](https://github.com/goblindegook/scopa)
: The Italian card game of [Scopa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopa) in TypeScript and React.

## WordPress

I've moved on from WordPress development, and the following are no longer actively maintained.

[Genesis Starter](https://github.com/goblindegook/genesis-starter)
: A WordPress starter theme with sophisticated enhancements and tools for custom [Genesis Framework](http://www.studiopress.com)-based projects.

[Syllables](https://packagist.org/packages/goblindegook/syllables)
: A collection of minimalistic classes and functions to aid WordPress development. Frequently-used code from my WordPress projects is thoroughly groomed and receives 100% test coverage before it ends up here.

[Cassava CAS Server](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-cas-server/)
: Cassava turns WordPress into a single sign-on authenticator for the [Central Authentication Service (CAS)](https://www.apereo.org/projects/cas) protocol. The plugin authenticates site members at the request of different CAS-enabled applications with just one password that never leaves the server.

[Post Glue](https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-glue/)
: WordPress sticky posts are great, but sometimes they stick to the bottom of your shoe. This plugin takes care of several issues found with the core implementation.

[Network Restricted Members](https://wordpress.org/plugins/network-restricted-members/)
: This WordPress plugin restricts members on a multisite install to the sites they belong to. I made it for log's private [P2](http://p2theme.com) network, which is open to all employees but allows only limited access for clients and contractors.
