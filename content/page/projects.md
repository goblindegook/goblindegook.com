Most of my open source endeavours revolve around the web, using JavaScript or PHP targeting WordPress. The list below is only a selection of projects that I started --- you are welcome to visit [my profile page on Github](https://github.com/goblindegook/) for a fuller picture of my work and interests.

[funny](https://github.com/goblindegook/funny)
: A collection of tiny JavaScript modules for functional programming, inspired by Ramda and Lodash.

[littlefoot](https://www.npmjs.com/package/littlefoot)
: A jQuery-free rewrite of Chris Sauve's [Bigfoot.js](http://www.bigfootjs.com) for delightful footnotes, as used on this site.[^littlefoot]

[Dicionário](https://github.com/goblindegook/dictionary-react-redux-typescript)
: I created this simple dictionary application to become more familiar with TypeScript. It uses React, Redux and the [Dicionário Aberto](http://dicionario-aberto.net) JSON API.

[generator-pacote](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-pacote)
: A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) code generator for new NPM modules using modern JavaScript language features and unit tests that run in parallel.

[VVV Material Dashboard](https://github.com/goblindegook/vvv-material-dashboard)
: A Material Design dashboard for [Varying Vagrant Vagrants](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV) using React and Redux.

[B3](http://beebeebee.be)
: An experimental JavaScript starter theme for WordPress made with Bootstrap, Marionette.js and the WordPress REST API.

[Cassava CAS Server](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-cas-server/)
: Cassava turns WordPress into a single sign-on authenticator for the [Central Authentication Service (CAS)](https://www.apereo.org/projects/cas) protocol. The plugin authenticates site members at the request of different CAS-enabled applications with just one password that never leaves the server.

[Post Glue](https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-glue/)
: WordPress sticky posts are great, but sometimes they stick to the bottom of your shoe. This plugin takes care of several issues found with the core implementation.

[Network Restricted Members](https://wordpress.org/plugins/network-restricted-members/)
: This WordPress plugin restricts members on a multisite install to the sites they belong to. I made it for log's private [P2](http://p2theme.com) network, which is open to all employees but allows only limited access for clients and contractors.

[Syllables](https://packagist.org/packages/goblindegook/syllables)
: A collection of minimalistic classes and functions to aid WordPress development. Frequently-used code from my WordPress projects is thoroughly groomed and receives 100% test coverage before it ends up here.

[Genesis Starter](https://github.com/goblindegook/genesis-starter)
: A WordPress starter theme with sophisticated enhancements and tools for custom [Genesis Framework](http://www.studiopress.com)-based projects.

[gulp-font2css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-font2css)
: A [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) plugin to encode font files as CSS. This is meant to facilitate `localStorage` caching and deferred loading of fonts.[^localFont]

[delimiter-align](https://packagist.org/packages/goblindegook/delimiter-align)
: A PHP function that aligns and rebalances plain text multiline strings around a delimiter.

[^littlefoot]: Hello, world!
[^localFont]: This performance optimisation technique is [used by Smashing Magazine](https://gist.github.com/hdragomir/8f00ce2581795fd7b1b7), among others.
