Most of my open source endeavours revolve around the web, using TypeScript or just plain old JavaScript. The list below is only a selection of projects that I started --- you are welcome to visit [my profile page on Github](https://github.com/goblindegook/) for a fuller picture of my work and interests.

[`@pacote/*`](https://github.com/PacoteJS/pacote)
: A collection of utilities written in TypeScript and distributed under the [`@pacote` organisation on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/org/pacote).

[littlefoot](https://www.npmjs.com/package/littlefoot)
: A jQuery-free rewrite of Chris Sauvé's [Bigfoot.js](http://www.bigfootjs.com) for delightful footnotes, as used on this site.[^littlefoot]

[funny](https://github.com/goblindegook/funny)
: Tiny JavaScript modules for functional programming, inspired by Ramda and Lodash.

[Gatsby Starter (TypeScript)](https://github.com/goblindegook/gatsby-starter-typescript)
: A [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) static site starter using TypeScript with support for offline viewing, local search, responsive images, syntax highlighting, and Markdown content.

[generator-pacote](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-pacote)
: A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) code generator for new NPM modules using modern JavaScript language features and unit tests that run in parallel.

[Dicionário](https://github.com/goblindegook/dictionary-react-redux-typescript)
: I created this simple dictionary application to become more familiar with TypeScript. It uses React, Redux and the [Dicionário Aberto](http://dicionario-aberto.net) JSON API.

## WordPress

I've moved on from WordPress development, and the following are no longer actively maintained.

[Genesis Starter](https://github.com/goblindegook/genesis-starter)
: A WordPress starter theme with sophisticated enhancements and tools for custom [Genesis Framework](http://www.studiopress.com)-based projects.

[Syllables](https://packagist.org/packages/goblindegook/syllables)
: A collection of minimalistic classes and functions to aid WordPress development. Frequently-used code from my WordPress projects is thoroughly groomed and receives 100% test coverage before it ends up here.

[Cassava CAS Server](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-cas-server/)
: Cassava turns WordPress into a single sign-on authenticator for the [Central Authentication Service (CAS)](https://www.apereo.org/projects/cas) protocol. The plugin authenticates site members at the request of different CAS-enabled applications with just one password that never leaves the server.

[Post Glue](https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-glue/)
: WordPress sticky posts are great, but sometimes they stick to the bottom of your shoe. This plugin takes care of several issues found with the core implementation.

[Network Restricted Members](https://wordpress.org/plugins/network-restricted-members/)
: This WordPress plugin restricts members on a multisite install to the sites they belong to. I made it for log's private [P2](http://p2theme.com) network, which is open to all employees but allows only limited access for clients and contractors.
