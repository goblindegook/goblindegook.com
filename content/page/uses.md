## Hardware

I try not to have too many devices around me, and while I keep previous ones as backup, I dislike the idea of using two of anything on a daily basis. I also don't tend to be running the latest and greatest, I can go five or more years before I decide to upgrade my hardware.

My daily driver is a 13″ MacBook Pro from 2020 with the Apple M1 processor, hooked to an ultra-wide curved 34″ Samsung CJ79 monitor. Previously I used a 15″ Macbook Pro from 2015, one of the best Apple ever built, right before they ruined MacBooks with the butterfly keyboard. Speaking of which, my keyboard is a mechanical [Epomaker TH80 with linear Flamingo switches and an ANSI layout](https://epomaker.com/products/epomaker-th80?variant=40057578651721), and since I prefer trackpads over mice, I use a [first-generation Magic Trackpad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_pointing_devices#1st_generation_2) from Apple. Since I spend a significant part of the day pair programming or in calls, I wear a pair of Jabra Elite 85h wireless noise-canceling headphones.

I always have on me an [iPhone XS Max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_XS) that I also use to test the mobile applications I develop, and an Apple Watch SE from 2020 mostly for fitness tracking.

At home, I make fairly constant use of a couple of [HomePod Mini](https://apple.com/homepod-mini)s and an Ikea [Symfonisk speaker frame](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/symfonisk-picture-frame-with-wi-fi-speaker-black-smart-40487320/). I practice piano on an entry-level [Yamaha P-45 digital piano](https://usa.yamaha.com/products/musical_instruments/pianos/p_series/p-45/index.html). Occasionally, I play games on the PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch consoles.

Finally, I keep an iPad from 2018 mostly for reading music scores, although I sometimes take it with me for video and reading while traveling.

## Software

Since I use an Apple computer, it goes without saying that I'm on macOS. My main browser is [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) because it's lightweight and doesn't drain my laptop's battery like other browsers do.

I regularly keep [nvAlt](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) open for note-taking. There are millions of note-taking applications out there, but I am yet to find one as light-weight and seamless as this. I also like to take my (non-confidential) notes in plain text, eschewing proprietary formats or anything fancy that might get lost in a data migration. [TickTick](https://ticktick.com/) helps me stay organised and I've found the experience of using it mostly frictionless. I also try to write at least a journal entry a day with [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com).

Most of the applications I use for work, I use out of necessity. I wouldn't recommend a lot of them. When programming, I do enjoy using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org) is my preferred terminal (with the Z shell and [`tmux`](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)), and I'm liking [Tuple](https://tuple.app) for screensharing and pair programming.
