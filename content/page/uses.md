## Analogue

I've adopted the [Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com) method in December 2022. I'm still settling on some specifics but it helps me keep track of my tasks and habits, and is very satisfying to use.

I prefer paper books and like to read two or three concurrently. Very often I carry one around with me.

## Hardware

I try not to have too many devices around me, and while I keep previous ones as backup, I dislike the idea of using two of anything on a daily basis. I also don't tend to be running the latest and greatest, I can go five or more years before I decide to upgrade my hardware.

My daily driver is a company-issued 13″ MacBook Pro from 2020 with the Apple M1 processor, hooked to an ultra-wide curved 34″ Samsung CJ79 monitor. Previously I used a 15″ Macbook Pro from 2015, one of the best Apple ever built, right before they ruined MacBooks with the butterfly keyboard. Speaking of which, my keyboard is a mechanical [Epomaker TH80 with linear Flamingo switches and an ANSI layout](https://epomaker.com/products/epomaker-th80?variant=40057578651721), and since I prefer trackpads over mice, I use a [first-generation Magic Trackpad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_pointing_devices#1st_generation_2) from Apple. Since I spend a significant part of the day pair programming or in calls, I wear a pair of Jabra Elite 85h wireless noise-canceling headphones.

I always have on me an [iPhone XS Max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_XS) that I also use to test the mobile applications I develop, and an Apple Watch SE from 2020 mostly for fitness tracking.

At home, I make fairly constant use of a couple of [HomePod Mini](https://apple.com/homepod-mini)s and an Ikea [Symfonisk speaker frame](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/symfonisk-picture-frame-with-wi-fi-speaker-black-smart-40487320/). I practice piano on an entry-level [Yamaha P-45 digital piano](https://usa.yamaha.com/products/musical_instruments/pianos/p_series/p-45/index.html). Occasionally, I play games on the PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch consoles.

Finally, I keep an iPad from 2018 mostly for reading music scores, although I sometimes take it with me for video and reading while traveling.

## Software

Since I use an Apple computer, it goes without saying that I'm on macOS. My main browser is [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) because it's lightweight and doesn't drain my laptop's battery like other browsers do.

I regularly keep [nvAlt](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) open for general notes. There are millions of note-taking applications out there, but I am yet to find one as light-weight and seamless as this. I like to store my (non-confidential) notes in plain text, eschewing proprietary formats or anything fancy that might get lost in a data migration. I also try to write a more contemplative journal entry each day with [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com).

[TickTick](https://ticktick.com/) has kept me organised for several years now and I've found the experience of using it mostly frictionless, although I'm starting to prefer the analogue bullet journal for most tasks. TickTick is still great for shopping lists, keeping track of friends' birthdays[^1], and anything that needs to have a reminder attached.

Most of the applications I use for work, I use out of necessity. I wouldn't recommend a lot of them. When programming, I do enjoy using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org) is my preferred terminal (with the Z shell and [`tmux`](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)), and I'm liking [Tuple](https://tuple.app) for screensharing and pair programming.
