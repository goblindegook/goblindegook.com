> There are no old secrets. Secrecy is by its nature youthful, a process rather than collections of facts that no one knows. A secret is something that someone in particular doesn't know. How they are prevented from knowing what by whom and for how long are what matter most.

---Marius Kociejowski, _A Factotum in the Book Trade_
