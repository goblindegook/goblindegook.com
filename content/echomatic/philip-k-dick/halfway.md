> [H]ere is a thought not too pleasing --- as the external world becomes more animate, we may find that we --- the so-called humans --- are becoming, and may to a great extent always have been, inanimate in the sense that we are led, directed by built-in tropisms, rather than leading. So we and our elaborately evolving computers may meet each other halfway.

---Philip K. Dick, "The Android and the Human"
