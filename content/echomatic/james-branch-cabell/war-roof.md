> 'It is a stone roof, made of the two tablets handed down at Sinai, which God fits over Earth whenever men go to war. For He is merciful: and many of us here remember that once upon a time we were men and women. So when men go to war, God screens the sight of what they do, because He wishes to be merciful to us.'

> 'Why, but, of course, that is the roof's secondary purpose,' replied St. Peter. 'What else would you expect when the Master's teachings are being flouted? Rumors get through, though, somehow, and horribly preposterous rumors. For instance, I have actually heard that in war-time, prayers are put up to the Lord God to back His favorites and take part in the murdering. Not,' said the good Saint, in haste, 'that I would believe even a Christian bishop to be capable of such blasphemy: I merely want to show you, Jurgen, what wild stories get about.'
