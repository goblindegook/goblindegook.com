Lately I've been trying my hand at baking milk breads, especially burger buns,
but have never been happy about the structure, which often turned chewy and dense.

Enter _tangzhong_, which is a water roux that originated in East Asia and
consists of flour cooked in water and milk. When added to the mix, it vastly
improves the consistency of bread, making it as soft and airy as a cloud.

_Tangzhong_ can be prepared in a matter of minutes. Combine roughly 2 parts
wheat flour and 6 parts liquid (water, whole milk or a combination of both) and
whisk until well incorporated. Keep whisking over medium-low heat --- once the
mixture hits 65 °C, the starch in the flour will quickly thicken and gelatinise.
Once it reaches the consistency of pudding, you're done! Wait until it cools to
room temperature before you use it.

How much _tangzhong_ will depend on the amount of bread you're baking, and I
intend to experiment with proportions over the coming weeks. You can start by
setting aside around 5–10% of the total weight of flour in your recipe. Use
these 5–10% to make your _tangzhong_, adjusting the liquid content accordingly.

The ingredients for the _tangzhong_ are taken from the recipe amounts: set them
aside, then mix and cook them separately before combining them with the rest of
the dough.

Because the gelatinous starch will bind to more water molecules and prevent the
gluten from retaining them, your dough might become stiffer and less likely to
rise unless you increase your original recipe's hydration. Again, I will want to
experiment with it, but it seems 75% hydration is a good starting point for many
recipes.
