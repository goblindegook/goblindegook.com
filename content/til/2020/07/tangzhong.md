Lately I've been trying my hand at baking milk breads, especially burger buns,
but have never been happy about the structure, which often turned chewy and dense.

Enter _tangzhong_, which is a water roux that originated in East Asia and
consists of flour cooked in water and milk. When added to the mix, it vastly
improves the consistency of bread, making it soft and airy as a cloud.

_Tangzhong_ can be prepared in a matter of minutes. Combine roughly 2 parts
wheat flour and 6 parts liquid (water, whole milk or a combination of both) and
whisk until well incorporated. Heat it on medium and keep whisking --- once the
mixture hits 65 Â°C, the starch in the flour will quickly thicken and gelatinise.
You're done! Wait until it cools to room temperature before you use it.

How much _tangzhong_ will depend on the amount of bread you're baking, and I
intend to experiment with proportions over the coming weeks. You can start
setting aside around 10% of the total weight of flour in your recipe and adjust
the liquid content accordingly.

Because the gelatinous starch will bind to more water molecules and prevent the
gluten from retaining it, your dough might become stiffer and less likely to
rise unless you increase your original recipe's hydration. Again, I will want to
experiment with it, but it seems 75% is a good starting point.
